# Automobile Data Exploratory Data Analysis (UCI Imports-85)
This repository provides a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow for the Automobile (Imports-85) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The project focuses on understanding feature patterns, relationships, and statistical insights before model development.

⚙️ EDA Workflow
1. Import Data and Assign Column Headers
•	Load the dataset and assign meaningful, descriptive column names for better readability.
•	Display basic information (.info(), .head(), .describe()) to understand data structure and data types.

2. Analyzing Individual Feature Patterns Using Visualization
•	Use histograms, boxplots, and count plots to visualize the distribution of each feature.
•	Identify outliers, skewness, and spread for numerical features.
•	Examine the frequency and diversity of categories for categorical variables.

3. Correlation Analysis
•	Compute and visualize pairwise correlations among numerical variables using the .corr() method.
•	Identify potential linear relationships or multicollinearity among features.

4. Focused Correlation Study
Analyze relationships between the following numerical features:
•	bore
•	stroke
•	compression-ratio
•	horsepower
Generate correlation metrics and interpret the degree of linear association between them.

5. Scatterplot with Fitted Regression Line
•	Visualize pairwise relationships using scatterplots.
•	Add regression lines to evaluate trends and linear patterns (e.g., seaborn.regplot).
•	Example: horsepower vs. price.

6. Categorical Variables
•	Examine categorical attributes such as make, fuel-type, body-style, etc.
•	Use bar plots and count plots to visualize category frequencies.
•	Explore relationships between categorical and continuous variables using boxplots or violin plots.

7. Descriptive Statistical Analysis
•	Summarize central tendency, dispersion, and distribution using:
o	.describe() for numerical data
o	.value_counts() for categorical data
•	Compare mean, median, and standard deviation across different variables.

8. Basics of Grouping
•	Use groupby() operations to analyze aggregated statistics by categories (e.g., make or drive-wheels).
•	Identify which groups exhibit higher or lower mean prices or performance metrics.

9. Heatmap Visualization
•	Create a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships among numerical features.
•	Highlight strongly correlated or inverse-correlated variable pairs.

10. Pearson Correlation and P-Value
•	Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values to measure the strength and statistical significance of relationships.
•	Interpret the results to identify which features are meaningfully correlated with key targets like price.
