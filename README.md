# Data Exploratory Data Analysis (UCI Imports-85)
This repository provides a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow for the **Automobile (Imports-85) Dataset** and **Laptop Pricing dataset**. 
Automobile dataset was from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The project focuses on understanding feature patterns, relationships, and statistical insights before model development.

# ⚙️ **EDA Workflow**

## Import Data and Assign Column Headers

- Load the dataset and assign meaningful, descriptive column names for better readability.

- Display basic information (.info(), .head(), .describe()) to understand data structure and data types.


## Analyzing Individual Feature Patterns Using Visualization

- Use histograms, boxplots, and count plots to visualize the distribution of each feature.

- Identify outliers, skewness, and spread for numerical features.

- Examine the frequency and diversity of categories for categorical variables.


## Correlation Analysis
   
- Compute and visualize pairwise correlations among numerical variables using the .corr() method.

- Identify potential linear relationships or multicollinearity among features.


## Focused Correlation Study
   
From Automobile dataset, analyze relationships between the following numerical features:

- bore
- stroke
- compression-ratio
- horsepower

Generate correlation metrics and interpret the degree of linear association between them.


## Scatterplot with Fitted Regression Line
   
- Visualize pairwise relationships using scatterplots.

- Add regression lines to evaluate trends and linear patterns (e.g., seaborn.regplot).

- Example: horsepower vs. price.


## Categorical Variables
   
- Examine categorical attributes such as make, fuel-type, body-style, etc.

- Use bar plots and count plots to visualize category frequencies.

- Explore relationships between categorical and continuous variables using boxplots or violin plots.


## Descriptive Statistical Analysis
   
- Summarize central tendency, dispersion, and distribution using:
o	.describe() for numerical data
o	.value_counts() for categorical data

- Compare mean, median, and standard deviation across different variables.


## Basics of Grouping
   
- Use groupby() operations to analyze aggregated statistics by categories (e.g., make or drive-wheels).

- Identify which groups exhibit higher or lower mean prices or performance metrics.


## Heatmap Visualization
    
- Create a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships among numerical features.

- Highlight strongly correlated or inverse-correlated variable pairs.


## Pearson Correlation and P-Value
    
- Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values to measure the strength and statistical significance of relationships.

- Interpret the results to identify which features are meaningfully correlated with key targets like price.
